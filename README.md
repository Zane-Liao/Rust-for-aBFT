# HoneyBadgerBFT for Rust


* [中文](README_zh.md)

- This project is about the HoneyBadgerBFT implementation of aBFT (Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance), which aims to solve a way for the author to learn Rust and explore the future.

- I believe that blockchain technology will be as important as the Internet in the future, and as an infrastructure, it still needs a large number of people to build it.
- Suffering from the rapid development of the times and the changes around me, as a young person born in Generation Z, I have experienced the rapid development of the Internet. In the middle of the old era and the new era, I don’t know what the future is. People around me are telling me what is right and wrong, but they don’t tell me what is right and wrong. After learning Rust, I don’t know what it can do. So I found this algorithm on the Internet. I think it is very interesting and novel. My initial goal is to use Rust to implement this algorithm to make up for my struggle to find the practical application field of Rust. It is definitely not perfect in the early stage, and it is even very bad, but it does not mean that there will be no iteration and solution.
- I often suffer from the vision of the future of the times and the criticism of the current environment. The rapid development of the Internet breeds anxiety. I suffer from the incompatibility of the real environment around me. I also suffer from having nothing to do, but I believe that as long as I continue to explore and build, the anxiety will soon disappear.
- This is a very basic but ambitious project. I don't have any advantages, nor can I easily realize it now. I just have an idea, enthusiasm, and the passion to do something. If you are interested in this project, you are welcome to build it with me.
